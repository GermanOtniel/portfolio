        <p>
          Hello, my name is Otniel Guti√©rrez and I work as a Full Stack Web Developer. Since June 2018, 
          I've been involved in 4 different startups, alongside some personal projects. <br />
          These startups span various industries including restaurants, government, fintech, and 
          digital marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am skilled at both initiating projects from the ground up and integrating into existing ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those I've collaborated with describe me as detail-oriented, making minimal errors, and adaptable 
          to change. I view myself as persistent, proactive, and accountable. Additionally, 
          I highly value reciprocity in interpersonal relationships.
        </p>

        <p>My full name is Germ√°n Otniel Guti√©rrez Serrano, and I'm originally from Mexico City. 
        I'm 29 years old and happily married to Ilse ‚ù§Ô∏è, the love of my life.</p>
        
        <p>I consider myself a calm person; I prefer staying at home watching a good series rather 
        than going to a shopping mall, although I also enjoy walking in a beautiful, tree-lined park.</p>
        
        <p>I'm a fan of soccer, and my favorite team is Chivas de Guadalajara, as I believe this team 
        represents Mexican culture excellently.</p>
        
        <p>My favorite foods are aguachile, pozole, and the chicharron with cheese quesadillas that my mom makes.</p>
        
        <p>I am a believer in God and trust that the Bible is the word of God, but I respect the beliefs of any person.</p>

        <p>Some fun facts about me are that when I was little, a turkey ü¶É chased me in front of my whole family, and I ran 
        away screaming, "Mom, mom, a big bird wants to eat me!".</p> 
        <p>Then, on another occasion, while playing with a marble, I somehow managed to get it into my mouth and started 
        choking on it. I almost died until my dad helped me, and I ended up swallowing the marble. Needless to say, it 
        was my favorite one, and unfortunately, after a few days, I had to say goodbye to it as it went down the bathroom drain.</p>
