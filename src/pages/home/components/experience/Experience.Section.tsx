          <a href="https://www.f6s.com/company/1puntocinco#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1puntocinco</a> was a startup aiming to be the link between major brands and their target 
          audience by using staff from consumption centers (waiters, bartenders, etc.). This 
          startup sought to incentivize consumption center staff to sell strategic products 
          through various dynamics and rewards. I had the opportunity to develop the Progressive 
          Web App for the staff and the dashboard for the brands. Unfortunately, this startup 
          did not continue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of many consumption 
          centers during this challenging period.
